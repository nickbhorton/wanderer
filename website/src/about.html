        <hr>
        <p class="py-3">Wanderer is a small website project aimed at showcasing ultra marathon portfolios.</p>
        <h1 class="text-lg font-bold py-3">Why only ultra marathons?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="py-3">There are many featureful web apps and phone apps that are meant for all types of activities.
            This is not meant to be a social media app. Trust me, Strava is a much better place to share sub-ultra runs
            and all other types of activities.

        <h1 class="text-lg font-bold py-3">Why use Wanderer?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="py-3">
            Being an ultra marathoner myself, I feel that apps like Strava and Garmin Connect do not put effort into
            showcasing ultra marathon effort activities. This makes sense as most users will never
            run further than a marathon. Therefor spending time and money developing cool features for ultra marathoners
            will not recoup there investment. So the pitch is Wanderer will have cool analysis and features for ultra
            activites. The trade off is it will lack features that could more easily be aqired via another app.
